# This repo contains Helm charts for deploying ScorpioBroker

A `creds.yaml` file contains the following information which is injected into Helm during the build process:
- Credentials for pulling images from the **ibn40/digitaltwin** Docker Hub repository
- Client secrets for the five Scorpio Broker modules registered as Clients in Keycloak

Please ensure your `kubectl` is configured to use the credentials to your Kubernetes cluster by default. Generally this would mean adding your credentials to `~/.kube/config` file.

Note that the chart has been updated to pass the DB user password as an environment variable. This variable is initialised using a Kubernetes secret generated by the Zalando Postgres Operator. Deploying this chart without first deploying the Postgres Operator will create issues.

## Installation

Ensure the namespace exists before executing this command. You can create a new namespace using `kubectl create ns <namespace>`
```
helm install scorpio-release . -f creds.yaml -n <namespace>
```
